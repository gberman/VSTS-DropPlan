Setp 6: npm i -g tfx-cli
Inorder to test your plugin you will need to create or have a visual studio account.
On that account you will need to create a extension publisher.
Update the publisher id, in the vss-extention.json file.

Once your test extension is deployed to your local visual studio instance, share the extension with your project / account.
Once that is done you can install it.

Once installed you will see the new 'Drop Down-test' but it will not work.
It is looking for a local instance of the service that will host the extension.
This allows you to update the js and css files for rapid development.

Other Commands:
npm test - create extension package for a debugging  instance
npm prod - create extension package for a production instance

gulp       - build the dev and prod projects (dist directory is created)
gulp watch - sets up a web service https instance that allows the extension to function (https://localhost:8080)
